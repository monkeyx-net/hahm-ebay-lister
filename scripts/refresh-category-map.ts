/**
 * Regenerate the static CATEGORY_MAP / LEAF_FALLBACKS in lib/ebay/publish.ts
 * for the eBay marketplace you are configured for — using eBay's Taxonomy API
 * as the source of truth.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * eBay category IDs are per-marketplace: the UK category tree is id 3, the US
 * tree is id 0, Germany is 77, etc. Some IDs coincide across sites but many do
 * not, so a leaf id that is correct on eBay.com can be a wrong (or non-leaf)
 * category on eBay.co.uk. The live publish path already resolves the right leaf
 * for the active tree via suggestLeafCategory(); CATEGORY_MAP is only the
 * OFFLINE FALLBACK used when that Taxonomy call is unavailable. This script
 * regenerates that fallback so it matches whichever marketplace you list on.
 *
 * It does NOT edit publish.ts — it prints a ready-to-paste block so you can
 * review the resolved IDs before committing them.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   EBAY_CLIENT_ID=...     \
 *   EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=...  \
 *   EBAY_RU_NAME=...        \
 *   EBAY_CATEGORY_TREE_ID=3 \   # 3 = UK (the default), 0 = US, 77 = DE, ...
 *   EBAY_MARKETPLACE_ID=EBAY_GB \
 *   npx tsx scripts/refresh-category-map.ts
 *
 * Then paste the printed CATEGORY_MAP / LEAF_FALLBACKS into lib/ebay/publish.ts.
